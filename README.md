# Projet Segmentation

#### Segmentation project for medical images realised in the class of MTI865 - Deep learning for computer vision
This code was imported from a school repository to this public repository. For more information, please look at the [article](Challenge_MTI865_article.pdf) made for this project.

I have not implemented the whole project. Though I participated a lot, my primary contributions were :
- Implementing and testing different architectures in the `Models` folder
- Implementing the semi-supervised learning methods in `main.py`
- Working on the tracking of expirements with `WandB`
- Working on the main loop of training and validation in `main.py`
